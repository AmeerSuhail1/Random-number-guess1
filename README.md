# Random-number-guess

The Number Guessing Game is a Java-based application that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It offers an interactive command-line interface for users to input their guesses and aims to guess the correct number in the fewest attempts.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Utilizes Java's `Random` class to generate a random number within a user-defined range.
- **User Interaction**: Engages users through a command-line interface to input their guesses.
- **Feedback System**: Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or the correct number, enabling users to adjust their next guess accordingly.

## Usage

1. Run the program in your preferred Java development environment.
2. The program will prompt you to guess a number between a specified range.
3. Input your guess and receive feedback on whether it's too high, too low, or correct.
4. Keep guessing until you correctly identify the randomly generated number.

## Getting Started

To use this application:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled program in your terminal or command prompt.

## Code Overview

The program initiates by generating a random number within a specified range and prompts users to guess this number. Users can input their guesses, and the program provides feedback until the correct number is guessed.

## Example

An example interaction with the program:

```bash
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Try to guess it.
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 60
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 70
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 65
Congratulations! You've guessed the correct number in 5 tries.
```
